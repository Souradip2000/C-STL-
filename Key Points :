If unordered_map<int, int> gives TLE, then switch to map<int, int> and vice versa.
unordered_map average case time complexity is O(1) while the worst case is O(n).
map time complexity for avg case is O( log n ).

It is similar in the case of sets and unordered sets.




begin(), end(), etc. will always return an iterator.
using *arr.begin() will return the element. [ check lec01 notes ].
